# Framework — Patch Notes

## v1.0.0 (2026-04-06)

---

### Initial Release

First working build of Framework — a fast, native GNOME document viewer built
on MuPDF and DjVuLibre.

**Rendering backends.** PDF rendering via MuPDF with mutex-serialized
`fz_context` access for thread safety. DjVu rendering via DjVuLibre's
`ddjvuapi` with async decode waiting. Both backends implement a shared
`FwDocument` GObject interface with vtable dispatch — backend selection is
automatic based on file extension.

**Pre-cache engine.** A `GThreadPool` renders pages asynchronously into
`cairo_surface_t` surfaces stored in a hash table. Priority ordering: visible
pages first, then pages ahead of the scroll position, then pages behind.
Generation-based invalidation lets zoom/rotation changes cancel stale render
jobs without blocking. Memory is bounded to a 50-page sliding window — distant
pages are evicted to keep RAM in check.

**View widget.** Custom `FwView` implements `GtkScrollable` for proper
integration with `GtkScrolledWindow`. Continuous vertical scroll with kinetic
scrolling. Pages are laid out with cached y-offsets for O(1) page lookup.
Snapshot only paints pages visible in the current viewport. Horizontal scroll
offset applied when content exceeds viewport width.

**Fit-width zoom.** Default zoom on open scales the widest page to fill the
viewport. Calculation is deferred via `gtk_widget_add_tick_callback` until the
scrolled window has a real pixel allocation — no hardcoded fallback dimensions.

**Window.** `AdwApplicationWindow` with full header bar: sidebar toggle, zoom
controls (buttons + editable entry), filename title with tooltip, page
navigation (buttons + editable entry), search toggle, and primary menu.

**Keyboard shortcuts.** Ctrl+/- for zoom, Ctrl+0/1/2 for actual/fit-width/fit-page,
Page Up/Down for navigation, Home/End for first/last page, Ctrl+G for go-to-page,
F9 for sidebar, F11 for fullscreen, Ctrl+F for search.

**TOC sidebar.** `AdwOverlaySplitView` with tree view populated from the
document's outline structure. Click to navigate. Overlays on narrow windows,
sits beside content on wide windows.

**Fast page size reading.** PDF backend uses `pdf_page_obj_transform` to cache
all page dimensions at open time without loading full page objects — eliminates
the multi-second `fz_load_page` loop on large documents.

**DjVu support.** Full backend with page rendering, TOC extraction from
miniexp s-expressions, text extraction, and search. Render access serialized
via mutex.

**Data files.** Desktop entry, AppStream metainfo, GSettings schema (with enums
for zoom mode and view mode), and scalable app icon.
